Oh, little one! You've done it!<br>
The crisis in the north wing has been averted!<br>
But I"m afraid we still have some serious problems in the east and west wings!<br>
Go to the east wing... it's the administration wing... You must find out... <br>
Speak with Wendy, little one!<br>
Find out what's going on in the east wing...<br>
She's bound to know...<br>
My wonderful Wendy...<br>
awoke there... <br>
She should know the password!
