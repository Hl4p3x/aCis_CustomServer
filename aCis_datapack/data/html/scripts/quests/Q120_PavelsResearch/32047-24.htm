After making the Gigantic Golem, Dr. Chaos became obsessed with its power.<br>
Perhaps this happened because the Doctor was exposed to the Flames of Pa'agrio for too long.<br>
It is said that they are the flames of the gods themselves; no mere mortal can remain unscathed after bathing in them. They can be found within the Giant Research Wing.<br>
Those flames will not necessarily affect a creature created directly by the gods since they are already kin to the divine power. But be warned the creatures of the gods view each other as enemies... they will likely treat you likewise if you encounter them while in possession of the Flames of Pa'agrio.<br>
