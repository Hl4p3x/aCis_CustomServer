Measuring your abilities is actually very simple.<br>
Just raise some beasts and bring me the proof.<br>
Raise them well, so they have a good heart, and they'll produce a <font color="LEVEL">Crystal of Purity</font>. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 Crystals of Purity</font> and your ability will be proven.<br>
Remember to raise them along with your Clan, making sure to watch them closely.<br>
