Oh, how lovely! How did you know to bring me this rare and precious liqueur? Well, time for a cocktail!<br>
Ah yes, that's the stuff. It's been too long! Would you care for a nip? It really tastes wonderful!<br>
No? Well, I understand. It would most likely burn your tongue right out!<br>
Did I understand that you are a student of Hardin? Or, are you just a flunkie from the Ivory Tower? Well, no matter! A gift like this is always welcome! Please take this as a token of my appreciation!<br>
