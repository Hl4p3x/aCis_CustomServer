You have brought me the secret book! Uhhh...<br>
Oh, I'm very sorry. While you were away, you see, someone brought some precious ingredients and I spent my last adena purchasing them.<br>
Hmm... How about this? The recipe for making Wish Potion is written in the secret book that you have brought! I obtained most of the ingredients with this last purchase but there are still a few things I will need. If you could bring me those, I'll make Wish Potion for you that will grant all of your wishes! How about it? What a deal, huh?<br>
