<html><body>Guild Member Grey:<br>
We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should see <font color="LEVEL">Guild Member Tor</font>, he will know what requests have come in. If there is a job that you like, you can accept it.<br>
Hunters are also hired by individuals, not just through the guild. Recently <font color="LEVEL">Cybellin</font> asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter. Would you care to meet him?<br>
