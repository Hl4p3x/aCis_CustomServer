So, you wish to take the 2-circle hunting license test? Well I suppose you're up to giving it a try. As before, in the 2-circle test you must bring back at least three items written on the list. Of course, these items will be harder to obtain than those of the 1-circle test. Maybe you should look at the list first...<br>
