Why the long face? Don't you realize how valuable this membership card is! Do you think we ask just anybody to join our coin collecting guild?<br>
Once you get started, you will realize how valuable a membership card is.  In order to trade coins with other members, you must have a membership card! You are only allowed to trade with members of your level. As long as you remain active, your grade will rise. So don't worry!<br>
Ah! One more thing. If you bring back the coins you collected for each grade, you can trade them for valuable prizes! This is a great opportunity that you shouldn't take for granted!<br>
