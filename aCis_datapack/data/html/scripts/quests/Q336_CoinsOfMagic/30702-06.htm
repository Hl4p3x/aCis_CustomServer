<body>Guild President Bernard:<br>
To be honest with you, I opened an investigation after our last conversation. With the help of my guild members, I found out where a lot of those coins are hidden.<br>
The best I can tell, the <font color="LEVEL">Rakin</font> in the southern area of Aden, the <font color="LEVEL">Vanor Silenos</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Timak Orcs</font> of Northern Oren have coins.<br>
I'm not sure who else has them, but reliable sources tell me that some can be found on <font color="LEVEL">Oren's bandits, in the National Cemetery of Aden, Dragon Valley, the Land of Atrocity, the Garden of the Beast, the Valley of the Saint and the Battlefield of the Past</font>.
