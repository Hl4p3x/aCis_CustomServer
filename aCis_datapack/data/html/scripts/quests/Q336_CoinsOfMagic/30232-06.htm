Where is my coin? What do you mean you haven't gotten it yet? Did you think I would reward you for your empty hands? I want the Kaldis's Gold Dragon coin!<br>
It's not blood dre vanul!<br>
It's not Silver Unicorn!<br>
It is the <font color="LEVEL">Gold Dragon of Kaldis</font>!<br>
Go and get it!
