I get the feeling that you've played this game before. I would wager that a Dwarf invented it. I will place the coins in sequence by color and you have a predetermined number of choices to guess the sequence. I will tell you when you guess any of the coins correctly... It should be possible to determine the sequence by trial and error.<br>
