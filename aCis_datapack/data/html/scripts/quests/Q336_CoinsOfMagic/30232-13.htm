Excellent! You have mastered the skills necessary for A-Grade 2 Member Certificate. But there's a world o' difference 'tween Grade 2 and Grade 3. For that Certificate, you will need to pass a much more difficult — and dangerous — test.<br>
If you've the heart to attempt it, bring me these coins and you'll earn your Grade 2 Certificate.<br>

I will await your return. Good luck!
