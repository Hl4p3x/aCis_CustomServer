/**
 * Mass events, like sieges or raids require joining several {@link Party}. That's what {@link CommandChannel}s are for in the world of Lineage.<br>
 * <br>
 * Using a command channel:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A command channel can only be created by a character belonging to a clan level 4 and above. The clan needs to learn the Clan Imperium skill.</li>
 * <li>It takes at least 2 parties to create a command channel. One of the leaders need to use the /channelinvite command on any member of the other party.</li>
 * <li>Only the leader of a command channel can accept new parties to the CC.</li>
 * <li>If the main party is disbanded, the CC is disbanded as well.</li>
 * <li>If the CC leader is disconnected from the channel, a random player from the main party will become the new leader.</li>
 * <li>You can change the leader of the CC and the leader of the main party at the same time using the /changepartyleader [Character Name] command or from the Action Window.</li>
 * </ul>
 * More infos regarding Command Channel in general, and looting priorities in particular (official IL patch notes) :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Even without the clan skill Clan Imperium, it is possible to set up an allies channel and to send out invitations through an item, the Strategy Guide. The Strategy Guide item can be purchased in the Town of Aden, Rune Township, and the Town of Schuttgart.</li>
 * <li>While hunting a raid boss monster, the following requirements must be met in order to gain looting rights.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Raid monster: More than 18 members in the command channel.</li>
 * <li>Boss monsters (Queen Ant, Zaken, Orfen, Core, etc): More than 36 members in the command channel. When raiding Antharas, more than 225 members of the command channel must appear at Antharas' Nest in order to obtain first looting rights.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Five minutes after the battle with a raid boss monster ends, the looting right automatically changes into ordinary looting. But if another raid succeeds in hunting the same raid monster before the looting right changes into ordinary looting, the first raid obtains the looting right to that
 * raid boss monster.</li>
 * </ul>
