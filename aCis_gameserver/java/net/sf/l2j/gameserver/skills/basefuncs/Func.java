/**
 * A super class for all functions. {@link Func} is container used to calculate a {@link Stats}'s value. It contains the {@link Stats}, order and the value itself.<br>
 * <br>
 * When the calculation is required (via {@link Calculator}), each {@link Func} is called sequentially by its order. Lowest priority order is executed first, while same order are executed in unspecified order.<br>
 * <ul>
 * The order is defined by each inherited {@link Func}, as following:
 * <li>The base for all calculation is given from template.</li>
 * <li>0 = {@link FuncSet} is overriding the base (template value). E.g. weapon's P.Atk.</li>
 * <li>1 = {@link FuncBaseMul} is adding a flat ratio of base value to the result. Used by skills for critical chance only.</li>
 * <li>2 = {@link FuncBaseAdd} is adding a value to the result. Used by items's P.Def. and M.Def.</li>
 * <li>3 = {@link FuncEnchant} is adding a value to the result, based on enchant level of owned item. Used by items.</li>
 * <li>10 = Finalization of base value calculation, prior to other calculations. E.g {@link FuncPAtkMod}, {@link FuncMDefMod}, etc. Used by default in {@link Creature}.</li>
 * <li>20 = {@link FuncMul} and {@link FuncDiv} are providing multiplication operation of the result and value. E.g. skills' percentage bonuses.</li>
 * <li>30 = {@link FuncAdd} and {@link FuncSub} are providing summary operation of the result and value. E.g. skills' bonuses.</li>
 * <li>40 = {@link FuncAddMul} and {@link FuncSubDiv} are providing multiplication operation of the result and percent value. E.g. skills affecting resistances.</li>
 * </ul>
